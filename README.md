## Cian flat status checker
### A small helper for checking the relevance of the ad.

Cian is one of the best place to buy / sell and rent an apartment in Russia.
I wrote this small script to monitor my adverticement periodically.

Basically you can use it to search any keyword on any page periodically without modification.

To use it you should specify some varibles.
Script will check the specified ad link and if it's not in active status it will log in to your gmail account and send messages to any number of specified emails.
All this will be done once and you should start every time you want to check your ad.

I recommend to find a small linux machine and use cron to run script periodically.
There are more this around than you may think. For example this operation was done periodically by my printer :)
